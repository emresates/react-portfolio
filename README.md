# React Portfolio Page

## I inspired by another source and tried to design a portfolio page using react. 

### At the edges of the screen are work, about, skills, and blog page. There is a text in the upper right corner of the screen directing you to your e-mail and a logo in the upper left corner. There is a music button next to the logo. If clicked, Interstellar background music starts playing :smile: In the middle of the screen, we have a rotating react symbol. If you click on it, a small introduction comes out.

### Work page includes some of the projects I have done. Can be enriched with photography. About page has some information about me and the programming languages I use are written on the Skill page. There are posts published on the Blog page, but since I haven't written a post yet, I've used lorem posts and photos. Also, when scrolling, an anchor goes down.
